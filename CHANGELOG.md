## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-11

Resolves [#1](https://github.com/hulryung/kicad-lcsc-manager/issues/1): library paths are now user-customizable at two scopes (global and per-project), via a new in-plugin Settings dialog. No more editing JSON by hand to change where imports land.

### Added
- **Settings dialog** reachable from the ⚙ button in the import dialog. Edits four path values — library root, symbol file name, footprint folder, 3D model folder — with live path preview, input validation, and a per-field source badge (`[global]`, `[project]`, `[default]`, `[edited]`, `[source → scope]`).
- **Per-project overrides** via `<project>/.lcsc_manager.json`. Layered resolution: `default < global (~/.kicad/lcsc_manager/config.json) < project`. Each layer may store any subset of keys.
- **Scope-aware preview** in the Settings dialog: Global view shows `${KIPRJMOD}/…` template paths (project-agnostic), Project view shows the resolved absolute path against the currently open project, with `✓ exists` / `(will create)` indicators.
- **Import destination panel** in the main search dialog showing where the next import will land and which scope's settings are active (`This project only`, `Global`, `Default`, or `Project override + Global/Default for the rest`).
- Unit tests for config layering (`test_config_layering.py`, 13 tests), lib-table URI generation (`test_library_manager_uris.py`, 3 tests), and footprint converter 3D URI plumbing (`test_footprint_converter_3d_uri.py`, 3 tests).

### Fixed
- **Hardcoded library paths**: `sym-lib-table` URI, `fp-lib-table` URI, and the 3D model reference inside generated `.kicad_mod` files were embedded as string literals (`${KIPRJMOD}/libs/lcsc/...`). They now flow from the user's config so customization actually takes effect end-to-end.

### Changed
- Global config file is no longer seeded with defaults on first run. `~/.kicad/lcsc_manager/config.json` starts empty so the Settings UI can accurately mark which keys are real user overrides vs. inherited defaults.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-08

Major integration of fixes ported from [easyeda2kicad.py v1.0.1](https://github.com/uPesy/easyeda2kicad.py) upstream. Improves correctness for footprint layer assignment, multi-unit symbol pin numbers, 3D model placement, and via handling. Several latent bugs in the JLC2KiCad_lib fork are fixed.

### Fixed
- **Footprint layer mapping**: corrected 7 EasyEDA layers that were miswired to wrong KiCad layers. TopAssembly (13) now lands on `F.Fab` instead of the wrong-side `B.Fab`; BottomAssembly (14) on `B.Fab` instead of `F.CrtYd`. Component Shape (99), Lead Shape (100), and Component Polarity (101) now map to `F.CrtYd`, `F.Fab`, and `F.SilkS` instead of being dumped on User.1/2/3.
- **Multi-unit symbol pin numbers**: canonical KiCad pin numbers are now extracted from the `^^num` segment (segment 4, field 4) instead of `spice_pin_number`. Multi-unit ICs (gates, dual op-amps, drivers) now show correct pin numbers.
- **3D model placement**: models are now XY-centered and Z bottom-aligned on the footprint origin, with EasyEDA `c_origin` translation offset applied (including upstream's Y axis negation and Z-axis canvas-unit scaling). Previously imported models were offset from the footprint reference.
- **Vias (`h_VIA`)**: implemented as plated through-hole (THT) pads matching upstream's `KI_VIA` template. Previously vias were silently dropped via a warning-only stub, breaking thermal relief and ground via connectivity.
- **SOLIDREGION H/V commands**: SVG path parser now handles horizontal (`H`) and vertical (`V`) commands. Rectangular silkscreen/edge-cut outlines are no longer silently truncated.
- **Pad number normalization**: `NAME(NUMBER)`-style EasyEDA pad numbers (e.g. `"A(1)"`, `"VCC(3)"`) are now normalized to the bare number. Fixes BGA/connector imports.
- **macOS KiCad SSL certificate verification**: API client now detects KiCad's bundled `certifi` inside `KiCad.app` (sorted by mtime for newest install) and falls back to the `certifi` package. Prevents `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` inside KiCad's embedded Python.
- **3D model OBJ→WRL conversion**: removed a corrupt-vertex-ordering `points.insert(-1, points[-1])` line, fixed transparency parser collision with `Kd` lines, added Rec.601 luminance-based `ambientIntensity` computation, and protected `material_id` against unbound variable on malformed OBJ.
- **SOLIDREGION filter**: decorative SOLIDREGIONs on layers 100/101 (lead solder indicators, pin-1 markers) are now dropped via an allow-list, matching upstream. Import output is significantly cleaner.

### Added
- **Opt-in disk cache** for EasyEDA component JSON responses. Gated on `api_cache_enabled` config flag (default `false`). Cache directory: `~/.kicad_lcsc_manager_cache/`. Atomic writes, corrupt-file cleanup, and opt-in-by-default design preserve existing behaviour.
- **Unit test infrastructure** under `tests/`: `test_3d_centering.py` (6), `test_lcsc_cache.py` (7), `test_footprint_handlers_patches.py` (20), `test_symbol_pin_numbers.py` (4), `test_regression_components.py` (2 E2E). Plugin `__init__.py` now guards the KiCad plugin registration so submodules can be imported for testing outside KiCad.

### Notes
- **Backward compatibility**: Footprints imported with previous versions have graphics on the old (wrong) layers. Already-placed footprints in existing projects are unchanged — only new imports use the corrected mappings.
- **Attribution**: Conversion logic adapted from [easyeda2kicad.py v1.0.1](https://github.com/uPesy/easyeda2kicad.py). Each ported function carries a `"Ported from easyeda2kicad.py v1.0.1"` docstring for traceability.
