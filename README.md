# KiCad LCSC Manager Plugin

A KiCad plugin that allows you to search and import electronic components from LCSC/EasyEDA and JLCPCB directly into your KiCad projects, including symbols, footprints, and 3D models.

> **🚀 v0.3.0 — Upstream integration (2026-04-08)**: This release incorporates significant conversion-logic fixes **ported directly from [easyeda2kicad.py v1.0.1](https://github.com/uPesy/easyeda2kicad.py)** by [uPesy](https://github.com/uPesy). Highlights:
>
> - **Footprint layer mapping fixed** — 7 previously-miswired EasyEDA layers (TopAssembly/BottomAssembly/LIBBODY/etc.) now land on the correct KiCad layers instead of the wrong side of the board or the User.1/2/3 junk drawer.
> - **Multi-unit symbol pin numbers** — gates, dual op-amps, and multi-channel drivers now get the canonical KiCad pin number from the `^^num` segment instead of the wrong `spice_pin_number`.
> - **3D model placement** — models are XY-centered, Z bottom-aligned, and positioned at the EasyEDA `c_origin` offset (with correct Y negation and canvas-unit scaling).
> - **Plated vias** — `h_VIA` now emits real `thru_hole` pads with `*.Cu *.Paste *.Mask`, matching upstream. Previously vias were silently dropped.
> - **Footprint SVG path parser** — `H` and `V` commands are now handled (rectangular silkscreen outlines no longer truncate).
> - **Pad number normalization** — `"VCC(3)"` → `"3"` for BGA/connector parts.
> - **macOS KiCad SSL** — auto-detects KiCad's bundled `certifi` so HTTPS calls don't fail in KiCad's embedded Python.
> - **Opt-in disk cache** for EasyEDA component JSON (off by default).
>
> See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and the **[Credits](#credits)** section for full attribution.

## 📥 Installation

> **Note about KiCad PCM**: This plugin is **not available in the official KiCad Plugin and Content Manager** due to KiCad's commercial services policy. Plugins that directly integrate with commercial APIs (like LCSC/JLCPCB) require a formal contract between the service provider and the KiCad team. As a third-party developer, I cannot submit to the official PCM. However, you can install it through the methods below.

### Method 1: Install via Custom Repository (Easiest)

1. Open KiCad PCB Editor
2. Go to **Tools → Plugin and Content Manager**
3. Click **Manage** (bottom-left)
4. Click **Add Repository**
5. Enter the following URL:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hulryung/kicad-lcsc-manager/main/repository.json
   ```
6. Click **OK** and close the repository manager
7. Search for **"LCSC Manager"** in the PCM
8. Click **Install**
9. Restart KiCad

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. **Download the latest release**
   - Go to [Releases](https://github.com/hulryung/kicad-lcsc-manager/releases)
   - Download `kicad-lcsc-manager-x.x.x.zip` from the latest release

2. **Extract to KiCad plugins directory**

   Find your KiCad version (e.g., 9.0) and extract to:

   - **Windows**:
     ```
     C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Documents\KiCad\9.0\3rdparty\plugins\
     ```
   - **macOS**:
     ```
     ~/Documents/KiCad/9.0/3rdparty/plugins/
     ```
   - **Linux**:
     ```
     ~/.local/share/kicad/9.0/3rdparty/plugins/
     ```

3. **Install Python dependencies** ⚠️ **REQUIRED**

   **IMPORTANT**: The plugin will NOT work without these Python packages!

   Install them using KiCad's Python (not your system Python):

   **macOS**:
   ```bash
   /Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3 -m pip install --user requests pydantic
   ```

   **Windows** (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   & "C:\Program Files\KiCad\9.0\bin\python.exe" -m pip install --user requests pydantic
   ```

   **Linux**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install --user requests pydantic
   ```

4. **Restart KiCad completely**

5. **Verify installation**
   - Open KiCad PCB Editor
   - You should see the LCSC Manager icon in the toolbar
   - Or go to **Tools → External Plugins → LCSC Manager**

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Open KiCad PCB Editor** with a saved project
2. **Launch the plugin**:
   - Click the LCSC Manager icon in the toolbar, or
   - Go to **Tools → External Plugins → LCSC Manager**

### Search and Preview Components

3. **Search for components**:
   - Enter search terms (e.g., "RP2040", "10uF", "0603")
   - Optionally filter by package type (e.g., "LQFN", "SOT23")
   - Press **Enter** or click **Search**

4. **Browse results**:
   - View component list with LCSC ID, name, package, price, stock, and type
   - Click any column header to sort results
   - Select a component to view previews

5. **Review previews**:
   - **Symbol tab**: Symbol preview from EasyEDA
   - **Footprint tab**: Footprint preview from EasyEDA
   - Previews load asynchronously - you can browse and import while loading

### Import Components

6. **Select import options**:
   - ✓ Import Symbol
   - ✓ Import Footprint
   - ✓ Import 3D Model

7. **Click "Import Selected"** to add the component to your project

8. **Find imported components** in your project libraries (default paths):
   - Symbol: `<project>/libs/lcsc/symbols/lcsc_imported.kicad_sym`
   - Footprint: `<project>/libs/lcsc/footprints.pretty/`
   - 3D Models: `<project>/libs/lcsc/3dmodels/`

### Customizing library paths

Click the **⚙ Settings…** button in the import dialog to change where LCSC
components are stored. Four values are configurable:

| Field | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `library_path` | `libs/lcsc` | Root folder relative to the project |
| `symbol_lib_name` | `lcsc_imported.kicad_sym` | Symbol library filename |
| `footprint_lib_name` | `footprints.pretty` | Footprint library folder |
| `model_3d_path` | `3dmodels` | 3D model folder |

Settings can be saved at one of two scopes:

- **Global** — `~/.kicad/lcsc_manager/config.json`. Applies to every project
  unless overridden.
- **This project only** — `<project>/.lcsc_manager.json`. Overrides the
  global config for that project. Commit this file if you want the layout
  shared with your team, or add it to `.gitignore` if it's personal.

Resolution order is `default < global < project`. The Settings dialog shows a
live preview of the resolved absolute paths and indicates which scope each
value comes from. Changes apply to *future* imports only — existing libraries
are not moved automatically.

### Tips

- **Search by LCSC ID**: Enter part numbers like "C2040" for exact matches
- **Search by value**: Try "10uF", "100nF", "10k" to find capacitors and resistors
- **Filter by package**: Add package filter like "0603", "0805", "SOT23" for better results
- **Browse quickly**: Click through components rapidly - previews load in the background
- **Check stock**: Basic parts are usually cheaper and more available than Extended parts

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

To remove the plugin from your system:

```bash
bash uninstall_test.sh
```

The script will:
- Detect and remove the plugin from KiCad plugins directory
- Optionally remove Python dependencies (if not used by other apps)

## ❓ FAQ

### Why isn't this available in the official KiCad PCM?

According to [KiCad's commercial services policy](https://dev-docs.kicad.org/en/addons/index.html#_commercial_services), plugins that directly integrate with commercial APIs (like LCSC/JLCPCB) require a formal contract between the service provider and the KiCad team. As a third-party developer, I cannot submit to the official PCM without such a contract.

However, you can still easily install this plugin via:
- **Custom repository** in KiCad PCM (recommended)
- **Manual installation** from GitHub releases

### How do I update the plugin?

**If installed via custom repository:**
- The plugin will show update notifications in KiCad PCM
- Click "Update" when a new version is available

**If installed manually:**
- Check the [Releases page](https://github.com/hulryung/kicad-lcsc-manager/releases) for new versions
- Download and extract the new version to the same location
- Restart KiCad

### Does this work with KiCad 7 or 8?

This plugin is primarily developed and tested with KiCad 9.0. It may work with KiCad 7.0+ but is not officially tested or supported.

### The previews are not showing. What should I do?

Previews are fetched directly from EasyEDA's SVG API and displayed in a WebView. Make sure you have an internet connection. If a component has no preview data on EasyEDA, a placeholder message will be shown.

### Can I search for components without LCSC part numbers?

Yes! You can search by:
- Component name (e.g., "RP2040", "ATmega328")
- Component value (e.g., "10uF", "100k")
- Package type (e.g., "0603", "SOT23", "LQFN")
- Or any combination of these

### Are 3D models included?

Yes, both WRL (VRML) and STEP formats are downloaded when available. They are automatically linked to the footprint.
