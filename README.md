# LCSC Manager for Autodesk Fusion Electronics

> **Port and attribution:** This repository is an Autodesk Fusion Electronics
> port of [hulryung/kicad-lcsc-manager](https://github.com/hulryung/kicad-lcsc-manager),
> the original KiCad LCSC Manager plugin by
> [hulryung](https://github.com/hulryung). The original author deserves credit
> for the KiCad plugin and the catalog workflow on which this port is based.

The Fusion port searches LCSC/EasyEDA and JLCPCB, previews product photos,
symbols, and footprints, generates a Fusion-compatible EAGLE `.lbr`, and
downloads available STEP models. The original KiCad plugin remains included in
this fork.

## Install the Fusion add-in

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nikokozak/fusion-lcsc-manager.git
cd fusion-lcsc-manager
python3 -m pip install --target fusion/LCSCManagerFusion/lib requests
```

On Windows, use `py -3` instead of `python3`. Keep the cloned repository in a
permanent location; Fusion will link to it directly.

### 2. Link it in Fusion

1. Start Fusion and open **Utilities → Scripts and Add-Ins**.
2. Select the **Add-Ins** tab.
3. Click the **+** menu and choose **Script or add-in from device**.
4. Select `fusion/LCSCManagerFusion` inside the cloned repository.
5. Select **LCSCManagerFusion** in the list and click **Run**.
6. Open **LCSC Manager** from Fusion's global quick-access toolbar.

Fusion remembers the linked folder and starts the add-in automatically on
future launches. Autodesk documents this workflow in
[How to install an add-in or script](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/?caas=caas%2Fsfdcarticles%2Fsfdcarticles%2FHow-to-install-an-ADD-IN-and-Script-in-Fusion-360.html).

### 3. Test an import

1. Search for an LCSC number such as `C2040` and select a result.
2. Confirm that its product photo, symbol, and footprint previews load.
3. Keep the default destination or choose another path ending in `.lbr`, then
   click **Import selected**.
4. In a Fusion Electronics design, open **Library Manager → Private
   Libraries → Import/restore Libraries**, select the generated `.lbr`, and
   activate it.

The default output is
`~/Documents/Fusion 360/LCSC/lcsc_imported.lbr`. When a model is available, its
STEP file is saved beside it under `lcsc_imported.3dmodels/` and must currently
be attached in Fusion's package editor. See [FUSION.md](FUSION.md) for usage,
development setup, current limitations, and safety checks before fabrication.

### Troubleshooting

- **No toolbar button:** In **Scripts and Add-Ins**, stop and run the add-in
  again. If it is not listed, use **+ → Script or add-in from device**.
- **An old or broken UI remains:** Stop the add-in, run `git pull` in the cloned
  repository, then restart Fusion and run the add-in again.
- **The add-in reports a Python import error:** Run the `pip install --target`
  command from step 1 again.
- **A specific part has no CAD data:** Some LCSC listings do not have EasyEDA
  symbol or footprint data. Try a known part such as `C2040` to distinguish a
  listing limitation from an installation problem.

## Original KiCad plugin

The upstream plugin searches and imports LCSC/EasyEDA and JLCPCB components
directly into KiCad projects, including symbols, footprints, and 3D models.

> **🚀 v0.5.0 — Footprint pipeline switched to upstream (2026-05-11)**: The footprint converter is now backed by a vendored copy of [easyeda2kicad.py v1.0.1](https://github.com/uPesy/easyeda2kicad.py) (see `plugins/lcsc_manager/vendor/easyeda2kicad/`), eliminating the `KicadModTree` runtime dependency. Footprints that previously fell back to a 2-pad placeholder on installs without `KicadModTree` now convert correctly. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) for licensing.
>
> **v0.4.0** added a Settings dialog and per-project / global library-path overrides — see the "Customizing library paths" section below.

## 📥 KiCad installation

> **Note about KiCad PCM**: This plugin is **not available in the official KiCad Plugin and Content Manager** due to KiCad's commercial services policy. Plugins that directly integrate with commercial APIs (like LCSC/JLCPCB) require a formal contract between the service provider and the KiCad team. As a third-party developer, I cannot submit to the official PCM. However, you can install it through the methods below.

### Method 1: Install via Custom Repository (Easiest)

1. Open the **Plugin and Content Manager**:
   - From the **main KiCad window** (the project launcher), click the
     **Plugin and Content Manager** button/icon, **or**
   - From an editor, go to **Tools → Plugin and Content Manager**

   > **macOS note:** If you don't see it under the *Tools* menu, look on the
   > main KiCad launcher window instead — on some builds the entry only lives
   > there (toward the bottom of the window), not inside the PCB/Schematic
   > editors.
2. Click **Manage...** (bottom-left)
3. Click **Add Repository**, paste this URL, and click **OK**:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hulryung/kicad-lcsc-manager/main/repository.json
   ```
4. Close the repository manager, then switch the **repository dropdown**
   (top of the PCM) to **LCSC Manager** so the plugin appears in the list
5. Select **LCSC Manager** and click **Install**
6. Click **Apply Pending Changes** (bottom-right) — this is what actually
   downloads and installs the plugin
7. **Quit and restart KiCad completely.** If the plugin still doesn't load
   (the Install button hangs, or no icon appears), reboot your machine — on
   macOS a stale KiCad/Python state can block the first load until a full
   restart.

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. **Download the latest release**
   - Go to [Releases](https://github.com/hulryung/kicad-lcsc-manager/releases)
   - Download `kicad-lcsc-manager-x.x.x.zip` from the latest release

2. **Extract to KiCad plugins directory**

   Find your KiCad version (e.g., 9.0) and extract to:

   - **Windows**:
     ```
     C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Documents\KiCad\9.0\3rdparty\plugins\
     ```
   - **macOS**:
     ```
     ~/Documents/KiCad/9.0/3rdparty/plugins/
     ```
   - **Linux**:
     ```
     ~/.local/share/kicad/9.0/3rdparty/plugins/
     ```

3. **Install Python dependencies** ⚠️ **REQUIRED**

   **IMPORTANT**: The plugin will NOT work without these Python packages!

   Install them using KiCad's Python (not your system Python):

   **macOS**:
   ```bash
   /Applications/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3 -m pip install --user requests pydantic
   ```

   **Windows** (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   & "C:\Program Files\KiCad\9.0\bin\python.exe" -m pip install --user requests pydantic
   ```

   **Linux**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install --user requests pydantic
   ```

4. **Restart KiCad completely**

5. **Verify installation**
   - Open KiCad PCB Editor
   - You should see the LCSC Manager icon in the toolbar
   - Or go to **Tools → External Plugins → LCSC Manager**

## 🚀 Usage

> **Where the plugin lives:** LCSC Manager runs in the **PCB Editor**
> (pcbnew), not the Schematic Editor. KiCad's Python action-plugin API is
> only available in the PCB Editor, so **Search and Import** appears there —
> launch it from the PCB Editor even if you start your design in the
> schematic. Imported symbols are still added to your project's symbol
> library and become available in the Schematic Editor.

### Quick Start

1. **Open KiCad PCB Editor** with a saved project
2. **Launch the plugin**:
   - Click the LCSC Manager icon in the toolbar, or
   - Go to **Tools → External Plugins → LCSC Manager**

### Search and Preview Components

3. **Search for components**:
   - Enter search terms (e.g., "RP2040", "10uF", "0603")
   - Optionally filter by package type (e.g., "LQFN", "SOT23")
   - Press **Enter** or click **Search**

4. **Browse results**:
   - View component list with LCSC ID, name, package, price, stock, and type
   - Click any column header to sort results
   - Select a component to view previews

5. **Review previews**:
   - **Symbol tab**: Symbol preview from EasyEDA
   - **Footprint tab**: Footprint preview from EasyEDA
   - Previews load asynchronously - you can browse and import while loading

### Import Components

6. **Select import options**:
   - ✓ Import Symbol
   - ✓ Import Footprint
   - ✓ Import 3D Model

7. **Click "Import Selected"** to add the component to your project

8. **Find imported components** in your project libraries (default paths):
   - Symbol: `<project>/libs/lcsc/symbols/lcsc_imported.kicad_sym`
   - Footprint: `<project>/libs/lcsc/footprints.pretty/`
   - 3D Models: `<project>/libs/lcsc/3dmodels/`

### Customizing library paths

Click the **⚙ Settings…** button in the import dialog to change where LCSC
components are stored. Four values are configurable:

| Field | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `library_path` | `libs/lcsc` | Root folder relative to the project |
| `symbol_lib_name` | `lcsc_imported.kicad_sym` | Symbol library filename |
| `footprint_lib_name` | `footprints.pretty` | Footprint library folder |
| `model_3d_path` | `3dmodels` | 3D model folder |

Settings can be saved at one of two scopes:

- **Global** — `~/.kicad/lcsc_manager/config.json`. Applies to every project
  unless overridden.
- **This project only** — `<project>/.lcsc_manager.json`. Overrides the
  global config for that project. Commit this file if you want the layout
  shared with your team, or add it to `.gitignore` if it's personal.

Resolution order is `default < global < project`. The Settings dialog shows a
live preview of the resolved absolute paths and indicates which scope each
value comes from. Changes apply to *future* imports only — existing libraries
are not moved automatically.

### Tips

- **Search by LCSC ID**: Enter part numbers like "C2040" for exact matches
- **Search by value**: Try "10uF", "100nF", "10k" to find capacitors and resistors
- **Filter by package**: Add package filter like "0603", "0805", "SOT23" for better results
- **Browse quickly**: Click through components rapidly - previews load in the background
- **Check stock**: Basic parts are usually cheaper and more available than Extended parts

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

To remove the plugin from your system:

```bash
bash uninstall_test.sh
```

The script will:
- Detect and remove the plugin from KiCad plugins directory
- Optionally remove Python dependencies (if not used by other apps)
- Optionally remove configuration and logs

Alternatively, manually remove:
- Plugin: `~/Documents/KiCad/9.0/3rdparty/plugins/com_github_hulryung_kicad-lcsc-manager/`
- Config/Logs: `~/.kicad/lcsc_manager/`

## ❓ FAQ

### Why isn't this available in the official KiCad PCM?

According to [KiCad's commercial services policy](https://dev-docs.kicad.org/en/addons/index.html#_commercial_services), plugins that directly integrate with commercial APIs (like LCSC/JLCPCB) require a formal contract between the service provider and the KiCad team. As a third-party developer, I cannot submit to the official PCM without such a contract.

However, you can still easily install this plugin via:
- **Custom repository** in KiCad PCM (recommended)
- **Manual installation** from GitHub releases

### How do I update the plugin?

**If installed via custom repository:**
- The plugin will show update notifications in KiCad PCM
- Click "Update" when a new version is available

**If installed manually:**
- Check the [Releases page](https://github.com/hulryung/kicad-lcsc-manager/releases) for new versions
- Download and extract the new version to the same location
- Restart KiCad

### Does this work with KiCad 7 or 8?

This plugin is primarily developed and tested with KiCad 9.0. It may work with KiCad 7.0+ but is not officially tested or supported.

### The previews are not showing. What should I do?

Previews are fetched directly from EasyEDA's SVG API and displayed in a WebView. Make sure you have an internet connection. If a component has no preview data on EasyEDA, a placeholder message will be shown.

### Can I search for components without LCSC part numbers?

Yes! You can search by:
- Component name (e.g., "RP2040", "ATmega328")
- Component value (e.g., "10uF", "100k")
- Package type (e.g., "0603", "SOT23", "LQFN")
- Or any combination of these

### Are 3D models included?

Yes, both WRL (VRML) and STEP formats are downloaded when available. They are automatically linked to the footprint.
